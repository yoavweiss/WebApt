# WebApt
The Web's package manager

## Why???
This is a proof of concept following a mail I sent the nextweb mailing
list.
It is not destined for production use at this point.

## How???
Iframe, bla bla

## Caveats
There are many, I'll list some:
* Does not play well with CSP - Since it involves a lot of inline JS
